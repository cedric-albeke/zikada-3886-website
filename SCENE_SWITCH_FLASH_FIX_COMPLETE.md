# ✅ SCENE SWITCH FLASH FIX COMPLETE

## Problem Solved

**Bright flashes during scene switches** have been completely eliminated by disabling GSAP filter animations.

---

## The Issue

GSAP was animating CSS filters (brightness, saturation, contrast) over 2-3 seconds during scene transitions, causing bright intermediate flashes.

---

## The Fix

Changed `applyFilterNow()` in `js/chaos-init.js` to apply filters **instantly** instead of animating them.

**Before**:
```javascript
gsap.to(document.body, {
    filter: finalFilter,
    duration: duration,
    ease: 'power2.inOut'
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
document.body.style.filter = finalFilter;
document.documentElement.style.filter = finalFilter;
```

---

## Safety Maintained

Filter sanitization still caps all values:
- ✅ Brightness: max 1.05
- ✅ Contrast: max 1.1
- ✅ Saturation: max 1.2
