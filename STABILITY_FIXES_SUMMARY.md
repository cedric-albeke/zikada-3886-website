# Stability Fixes Summary - October 31, 2025

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. DOM Growth Explosion (10k+ nodes)
**Problem**: Emergency restarts were calling `addScanlines()` and `addDataStreams()` repeatedly, creating duplicate DOM elements on every restart.

**Root Cause**: 
- `addScanlines()` created new `.scanlines` element every time
- `addDataStreams()` created new `.data-streams` container + 3 stream elements every time
- Emergency recovery system was triggering restarts frequently
- Each restart added 4+ new permanent DOM elements

**Fix**:
```javascript
// Added existence checks before creating elements
addScanlines() {
    if (document.querySelector('.scanlines')) {
        return; // Already exists, don't create duplicate
    }
    // ... create element
    scanlines.setAttribute('data-permanent', 'true');
}

addDataStreams() {
    if (document.querySelector('.data-streams')) {
        return; // Already exists, don't create duplicate
    }
    // ... create container and streams
    container.setAttribute('data-permanent', 'true');
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents exponential DOM growth during emergency restarts

### 2. Lottie Animation Re-initialization Loop
**Problem**: `LottieAnimations.init()` was destroying and recreating all Lottie players on every emergency restart, causing:
- 9 dotlottie-player elements destroyed
- 9 new dotlottie-player elements created
- Intervals cleared and recreated
- Massive DOM churn

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// OLD CODE
if (this.isInitialized) {
    this.destroy(); // Destroys everything
}
// Then recreates everything
```

**Fix**:
```javascript
if (this.isInitialized) {
    console.warn('⚠️ LottieAnimations already initialized, skipping duplicate initialization');
    return; // Don't destroy and re-create, just skip
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents Lottie DOM churn during restarts

### 3. Animation Accumulation
**Problem**: GSAP animations were accumulating to 100+ active animations, triggering emergency cleanups that removed 50-92 animations at once.

**Root Cause**:
- Permanent elements (scanlines, data streams) were being recreated with new animations
- Each emergency restart added new GSAP tweens without cleaning up old ones
- GSAP registry hit maxAnimations limit (100)

**Fix**: By preventing duplicate element creation (fixes #1 and #2), we also prevent duplicate animation creation.

**Impact**: Stable animation count, no more emergency cleanups

### 4. Intrusive Blackout Transitions
**Problem**: Scene transitions used 550ms fade-to-black + 700ms fade-in = 1250ms of blackout, very jarring.

**Old Code**:
```javascript
// Fade to black (longer, smoother)
try { this.showBlackout(1); } catch(_) {}
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 550));
// ... cleanup ...
// Fade in (longer, smoother)
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 700));
try { this.hideBlackout(); } catch(_) {}
```

**Fix**:
```javascript
// Cleanup previous overlays immediately
this.transitionOut();
if (signal?.aborted) return;

// Brief pause for cleanup to complete
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100));
if (signal?.aborted) return;

// Run target phase
try { this._phaseMap.get(next)?.(); } catch (e) { console.warn('Phase runner error', next, e); }
```

**Impact**: Instant scene transitions with only 100ms cleanup pause

## Files Modified

1. `js/chaos-init.js`
   - Added duplicate check in `addScanlines()` (line 1694-1696)
   - Added `data-permanent` attribute to scanlines (line 1718)
   - Added duplicate check in `addDataStreams()` (line 2098-2100)
   - Added `data-permanent` attribute to data streams container and streams (lines 2114, 2128)
   - Removed blackout fade transitions (lines 2190-2208)

2. `js/lottie-animations.js`
   - Changed `init()` to skip re-initialization instead of destroy+recreate (lines 191-193)

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes:
- DOM nodes: 10,363+ (threshold: 8,000)
- FPS: 6-9 (critical)
- Emergency cleanups: Every 30-60 seconds
- Animation count: 100+ → emergency cleanup removes 50-92
- Scene transitions: 1250ms blackout

### After Fixes:
- DOM nodes: Should stabilize around 2,000-3,000
- FPS: Should maintain 30-60
- Emergency cleanups: Rare or none
- Animation count: Stable around 20-40
- Scene transitions: Instant (100ms)

## Testing Plan

1. Monitor deployed app for 12+ minutes
2. Check logs every 2 minutes for:
   - DOM node count
   - FPS
   - Emergency cleanup triggers
   - Animation count
   - Health score
3. Verify no blackout flashes during scene transitions
4. Verify control panel accessibility

## Control Panel Accessibility

**Status**: Control panel HTML files are built and included in dist/:
- `dist/control-panel.html` ✓
- `dist/control-panel-v3.html` ✓

**Access URLs**:
- https://zikada.io/control-panel.html
- https://zikada.io/control-panel-v3.html

Nginx configuration already includes routing for `/control-panel` path.
