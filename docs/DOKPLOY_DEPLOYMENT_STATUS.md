# Dokploy Deployment Status

## Current Issue
The `nixpacks.toml` file was accidentally deleted, which caused Dokploy to attempt auto-detection. This led to build errors. 

## Solution Applied
Restored `nixpacks.toml` with the working configuration that:
- Uses Node.js 18
- Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies
- Runs `npm run build` (which includes the `prebuild` script to copy static assets)
- Uses `npm run start` to serve the application

## Changes Made in This Session

### 1. Traefik ACME Challenge Fix ✅
**File:** `dokploy.yml`
- Added ACME challenge path exclusion to HTTP router: `!PathPrefix(\`/.well-known/acme-challenge\`)`
- This allows Let's Encrypt to successfully issue certificates

### 2. Restored Nixpacks Configuration ✅
**File:** `nixpacks.toml`
- Re-created with proper build configuration
- Uses `npm ci` instead of `npm ci --only=production` (to include devDependencies like Vite)

### 3. Dockerfile Improvements ✅
**File:** `Dockerfile`
- Changed from `npm ci --only=production` to `npm ci` to include all dependencies for building
- Added cleanup of node_modules after build

### 4. Documentation ✅
Created several documentation files:
- `docs/DOKPLOY_TRAEFIK_CONFIG.md` - Traefik configuration guide
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - Deployment issue fixes
- `docs/FIND_TRAEFIK_NETWORK.md` - How to find Traefik network name
- `docs/TRAEFIK_ACME_FIX.md` - ACME challenge troubleshooting
- `.dockerignore` - Proper ignore patterns for Docker builds

### 5. Added .dockerignore ✅
**File:** `.dockerignore`
- Excludes unnecessary files from Docker builds
- Reduces build context size and build time

## Required Configuration in Dokploy UI

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variable in Dokploy:
- **Key:** `DOMAIN`
- **Value:** `zikada.io`

### Network Configuration
The network name is set to `dokploy-network` in `dokploy.yml`. If this doesn't exist in your deployment, you may need to adjust it or let Dokploy manage it automatically.

## Build Process

The deployment uses Nixpacks which:
1. Clones the repository
2. Detects `nixpacks.toml` configuration
3. Installs Node.js 18 and npm
4. Runs `npm ci` to install all dependencies
5. Runs `npm run build` which:
   - Executes `prebuild` script (copies static assets from root to `public/`)
   - Runs Vite build (copies everything from `public/` to `dist/`)
6. Starts the application with `npm run start` (http-server on port 3886)

## Traefik Labels

The `dokploy.yml` includes comprehensive Traefik labels for:
- HTTP router (with ACME challenge exclusion)
- HTTPS router (with Let's Encrypt certificate resolver)
- Proper routing and middleware configuration
- Service definition

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** all changes
2. **Set DOMAIN environment variable** in Dokploy UI
3. **Redeploy** the application
4. **Verify** Let's Encrypt certificate is issued
5. **Check** Traefik logs for any routing issues

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ Build succeeds with Nixpacks
- ✅ Static assets (animations, lotties, videos) are included in dist/
- ✅ Application serves on port 3886
- ✅ Traefik routes traffic with proper ACME challenge handling
- ✅ Let's Encrypt certificate is issued for zikada.io

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check `nixpacks.toml` is present in repository
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check Traefik network name matches your Dokploy setup
4. Review Traefik logs for certificate acquisition issues
5. Ensure DNS for zikada.io points to your Dokploy server
