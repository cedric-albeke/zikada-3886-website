# Traefik ACME Challenge Fix - Current State Analysis

## Problem Identified

Looking at your Traefik config, the HTTP router rule is:
```yaml
rule: Host(`zikada.io`)
```

But it should be:
```yaml
rule: Host(`zikada.io`) && !PathPrefix(`/.well-known/acme-challenge`)
```

The router is redirecting **all** HTTP traffic (including ACME challenges) to HTTPS, causing the 404 error.

## Current Traefik Configuration

Your routers are auto-generated by Dokploy with names like:
- `chaos-engine-animationengine-m0xssv-router-30` (HTTP)
- `chaos-engine-animationengine-m0xssv-router-websecure-30` (HTTPS)

This suggests Dokploy may be generating router names automatically.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Ensure Labels Are Applied (Recommended)

The `dokploy.yml` already has the correct labels with ACME path exclusion. Make sure:

1. **The deployment has been redeployed** after the label changes
2. **Check if Dokploy is reading the labels correctly**

To verify labels are applied:
```bash
docker inspect zikada-3886-website | grep -A 50 "Labels"
```

Look for labels starting with `traefik.http.routers.` and verify the rule includes `!PathPrefix`.

### Option 2: Edit Traefik Config Directly (Temporary Fix)

If labels aren't working, you can manually edit Traefik's dynamic configuration:

1. Find Traefik's dynamic config file (usually in `/path/to/traefik/dynamic/`)
2. Locate the router `chaos-engine-animationengine-m0xssv-router-30`
3. Update the rule to:
   ```yaml
   rule: Host(`zikada.io`) && !PathPrefix(`/.well-known/acme-challenge`)
   ```

**Note:** This is a temporary fix - it will be overwritten on next deployment if Dokploy manages it.

### Option 3: Use Dokploy's Built-in Redirect (If Available)

Dokploy might have a built-in redirect middleware that already handles ACME exclusion. Check:

1. Dokploy UI â†’ Traefik Settings
2. Look for existing middlewares
3. Use that middleware name instead of creating a new one

### Option 4: Priority-Based Approach

Set a lower priority for your HTTP router and let Traefik's internal ACME handler take precedence:

```yaml
# In dokploy.yml labels
- "traefik.http.routers.zikada-3886-http.priority=1"
```

Traefik's ACME challenge handler typically runs with higher priority, so it should catch the request first if your router has low priority.

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

1. **Check the router rule** in Traefik dashboard or config:
   ```bash
   # Get Traefik API endpoint (usually http://localhost:8080 or Dokploy's Traefik port)
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/http/routers | jq '.[] | select(.name | contains("chaos-engine"))'
   ```

2. **Test ACME challenge path manually**:
   ```bash
   curl -v http://zikada.io/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
   ```
   
   Should return 404 or handled by Traefik, NOT a redirect to HTTPS.

3. **Monitor Traefik logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs traefik -f | grep -i acme
   ```

4. **Check certificate status**:
   ```bash
   docker exec traefik cat /acme.json | jq '.letsencrypt.Certificates[]'
   ```

## Expected Result

After the fix, the Traefik config should show:

```yaml
chaos-engine-animationengine-m0xssv-router-30:
  rule: Host(`zikada.io`) && !PathPrefix(`/.well-known/acme-challenge`)
  service: chaos-engine-animationengine-m0xssv-service-30
  middlewares:
    - redirect-to-https
  entryPoints:
    - web
```

And ACME challenges should work without 404 errors.
