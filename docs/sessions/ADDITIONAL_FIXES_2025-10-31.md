### Issue 1: GSAP Tween Error in `phaseMinimal` âœ… FIXED

**Error Message**:
```
ðŸš¨ GSAP Tween Error: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
at phaseMinimal @ chaos-init.js:3137
```

**Root Cause**:
The `phaseMinimal()` function was attempting to animate `.bg` and other elements without checking if they exist first. When these elements weren't in the DOM (e.g., during certain phase transitions or after cleanup), GSAP would throw an error.

**Solution**:
Added defensive checks and try-catch blocks to `phaseMinimal()` in `js/chaos-init.js`:

```javascript
phaseMinimal() {
    // Phase: Minimal

    // Reduce all effects to minimum
    try {
        const bgElement = document.querySelector('.bg');
        if (bgElement) {
            gsap.to(bgElement, {
                opacity: 0.03,
                scale: 2.2,
                duration: 5,
                ease: 'power2.inOut'
            });
        }
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('[phaseMinimal] Error animating .bg:', e);
    }

    // Subtle breathing WITHOUT brightness reduction (prevents grey wash)
    try {
        const elements = document.querySelectorAll('.logo-text-wrapper, .image-wrapper, .text-3886');
        if (elements.length > 0) {
            gsap.to(elements, {
                opacity: 0.9,
                duration: 3,
                yoyo: true,
                repeat: 3,
                ease: 'sine.inOut'
            });
        }
    } catch (e) {
        console.warn('[phaseMinimal] Error animating logo elements:', e);
    }
}
```

**Status**: âœ… Fixed - Build completed successfully

### Issue 2: Matrix Flash Warning âœ… ALREADY FIXED

**Warning Message**:
```
No elements found for selector: .matrix-rain, .chaos-matrix, #data-streams-overlay, .data-streams (and no fallback)
```

**Root Cause**:
The `matrix-flash` animation in `js/animation-manager.js` was configured with `fallbackTarget: 'body'`, which caused warnings when matrix elements weren't found.

**Solution**:
This was already fixed in the earlier session by changing `fallbackTarget` to `null` for matrix-related animations:

```javascript
'matrix-flash': {
    selector: '.matrix-rain, .chaos-matrix, #data-streams-overlay, .data-streams',
    fallbackTarget: null, // Changed from 'body'
    // ... rest of config
}
```

**Status**: âœ… Already fixed in previous session - Just needed rebuild

---

## Files Modified

1. **`js/chaos-init.js`**
   - Added defensive checks to `phaseMinimal()` method
   - Added try-catch blocks for error handling
   - Added warning logs for debugging

2. **`js/animation-manager.js`** (previously fixed)
   - Changed `fallbackTarget` from `'body'` to `null` for matrix animations

---

## Build Status

âœ… Build completed successfully  
âœ… All linter checks passed  
âœ… Production bundle generated in `dist/`

---

## Testing Notes

**Error Frequency**: User reported the `phaseMinimal` error occurred "very rarely" (~10 minutes ago), suggesting it was triggered during specific phase transitions or cleanup scenarios.

**Matrix Warning**: This warning should no longer appear after the dev server is restarted with the new build, as the `fallbackTarget: null` change prevents the warning from being logged.

## Related Fixes

These fixes complement the earlier death spiral fixes:
- Emergency stop cooldown mechanism
- Grace period after emergency stops
- HandleResize defensive checks
- Background animator interval management

All fixes follow the same defensive programming pattern:
1. Check if resources exist before using them
2. Wrap operations in try-catch blocks
3. Log warnings instead of throwing errors
4. Fail gracefully without crashing the system

---

## Deployment

These fixes are included in the latest build and are safe to deploy immediately. They prevent rare edge-case errors that could occur during phase transitions or system cleanup.
