# STABLE BUILD - v1.0.0-stable
**Date:** December 18, 2024
**Commit:** 07dc619
**Branch:** dev

## Build Status: STABLE WITH KNOWN ISSUES

This is a functional stable build of the ZIKADA 3886 Records website with all core features operational.

## ✅ Working Features

### Core Functionality
- **Pre-loader Animation**: Fully functional with ZIKADA logo, eye imagery, and "3886" enter button
- **Dark Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Complete theme implementation with neon accents
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility via Webflow export

### Animation Systems
- **Matrix Rain Effect**: Optimized background matrix animation
- **Matrix Messages**: Dice roll system (15% chance every 5 seconds) with glitch text
- **Logo Animations**: Enhanced logo animator with multiple effects
- **Background Animations**: Circular grid (bg-2.svg) with rotation and scaling
- **Chaos Engine**: 3D particle effects and geometric animations
- **Text Scramble Effects**: Cyberpunk-style text animations

### Control Systems
- **Control Panel**: Full VJ control interface with:
  - Scene controls (8 preset scenes + auto mode)
  - Effect intensity sliders
  - Matrix message dice roll display
  - Performance monitoring
  - Preset management (Minimal, Balanced, Intense, Maximum)
  - Animation triggers

### Performance Systems
- **Performance Monitor**: FPS tracking and auto-degradation
- **Animation Supervisor**: Smart animation management
- **Element Pooling**: Efficient DOM element reuse
- **Interval Manager**: Centralized timing control

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Visual Issues
- **Grey Flashes**: Occasional grey screen flashes during heavy animations
- **Background Glitches**: Circular grid background may occasionally:
  - Stop animating
  - Become invisible (opacity issues)
  - Display duplicate instances

### Performance Issues
- **High CPU Usage**: Heavy animation load can cause:
  - Frame drops below 30 FPS
  - Browser slowdown on lower-end devices
  - Occasional freezing during scene transitions
- **Memory Leaks**: Long sessions may accumulate memory usage
- **Mobile Performance**: Reduced performance on mobile devices

### Minor Bugs
- **Animation Stacking**: Some animations may stack without proper cleanup
- **Z-Index Conflicts**: Occasional layering issues with overlapping effects
- **Matrix Rain**: May not display correctly on initial load
- **Control Panel**: Some sliders may not immediately reflect changes
- **Audio Player**: Disabled for performance reasons

## 📋 Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Webflow export)
- **Animation**: GSAP 3.13.0, anime.js, Lottie
- **Effects**: Custom chaos engine, matrix rain, WebGL effects
- **Fonts**: Space Mono, Anta, Inconsolata

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes (Future Work)

### High Priority
1. Fix grey flash issues by optimizing animation transitions
2. Stabilize background animations with proper initialization
3. Reduce CPU usage through animation throttling
4. Fix memory leaks in long-running animations

### Medium Priority
1. Improve mobile performance with reduced effects
2. Fix z-index layering issues
3. Ensure matrix rain consistent initialization
4. Optimize control panel responsiveness

### Low Priority
1. Re-enable audio player with performance safeguards
2. Add animation cleanup on scene changes
3. Improve browser compatibility
4. Add loading indicators for heavy operations
