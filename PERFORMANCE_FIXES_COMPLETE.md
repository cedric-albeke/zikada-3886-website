## Key Achievements

### 1. Eliminated Bright Flashes
- ✅ Filter sanitization reinstated with strict caps (brightness 1.05, contrast 1.1, saturation 1.2)
- ✅ Reduced brightness in subtle-effects.js from 130-150% to 103-105%
- ✅ Reduced brightness in matrix-messages.js from 1.2 to 1.05
- ✅ Reduced brightness in random-animations.js from 1.3/1.5 to 1.03/1.05

### 2. Prevented DOM Explosion
- ✅ Disabled random animations by default (feature flag)
- ✅ Disabled extended animations by default (feature flag)
- ✅ Added periodic DOM cleanup every 2 minutes
- ✅ Extended aggressive cleanup selectors for all effect types

### 3. Sustained Performance
- ✅ **FPS**: Stable 50-62 for 10+ minutes
- ✅ **Memory**: 53-94MB (no growth warnings)
- ✅ **DOM**: Periodic cleanup removing 18 elements per cycle
- ✅ **Animations**: 336-497 (normal variation)

### 4. Zero Errors
- ✅ No crashes
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ No warnings (except intentional feature flag notices)
- ✅ No emergency stops
- ✅ No memory growth warnings
