```bash
# Delete merged feature branches
git branch -d feature/v3-fx-fixes-layout-merge
git branch -d perf/health-20251003

git fetch --prune

# (Optional) View deleted branches in reflog
git reflog show --all | grep -i "branch"
```

---

## Recovery Instructions (If Needed)

If you accidentally delete a branch and need to recover it:

```bash
# Find the commit SHA
git reflog | grep <branch-name>

# Recreate the branch
git branch <branch-name> <commit-sha>
```

---

## Verification After Cleanup

After deleting branches, verify with:
```bash
git branch -a
git log --oneline --graph --all -10
```
